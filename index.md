## Overview
This course introduces students to principles of data science that are necessary for computer scientists to make effective decisions in their professional careers. 
A number of computer science sub-disciplines 
now rely on data collection and analysis. For example, computer systems are now complicated enough that comparing the execution performance of two different programs becomes a statistical estimation problem 
rather than a deterministic computation. This course teaches students the basic principles of how to properly collect and process data sources in order to derive appropriate conclusions from them. 
The course has main components of: basic probability, basic statistics and data wrangling, and basic data analysis using programming libraries.
